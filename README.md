HKKTagWriteView
===============

This is a view to input a text in a list of texts which are usually called as tags.
The view only supports a single line of tags with a horizontal scroll.

If you need to support multiple words with a single space in a tag, use the following property:

 - allowToUseSingleSpace


Now, this project contains an Objective-C version and a Swift version. But, an Objective-C version will be removed in the near future.


Installation
------------
It is available to use CocoaPods for the Swift version.
```
